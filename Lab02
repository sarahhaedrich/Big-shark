# Lab 2

## After downloading the data for Mt. Kilimanjaro from Earthdata Search, I had two tiles, with each tile covering a 1 degree by 1 degree area. I then knitted these two tiles together using the "Mosaicking Tool."

## I now have a map containing a digital elevation model (DEM) of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Before analysing the DEM, I first projected the recently mosaicked map into the UTM projection (Universal Transverse Mercator projection) from a geographic coordinate system, so that we can accurately analyze linear measurements. I then used the analyze hillshade tool to display the amount of light, or lack of light, that Mt. Kilimanjaro receives when the sun is set a specified azimuth angle and height. In this image, the azimuth is set at 315, and the height is set at 45 degrees.
