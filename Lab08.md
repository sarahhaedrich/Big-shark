# Lab 07 & Lab 08: Malawi Vulnerability Assessment: Looking at Reproducibility and Replicability


The goals of this lab are to test the reproducability of a multi-criteria analysis of vulnerability in Malawi based off the paper by [Malcolm, D.W., E.A. Weaver, and A. R. Krakowka, 2014](Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa An operationalized approach in Malawi.pdf).

We hope to replicate ![Figure 4](Screen Shot 2019-12-10 at 10.55.18 AM.png) and 80% of [Figure 5](Screen Shot 2019-12-10 at 10.56.34 AM.png) since we are unable to access 20% of the data used for this map in our time span. 


The data for this lab is attached [here](mwi_data.zip).
