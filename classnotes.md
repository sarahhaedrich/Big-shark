Lab04 - Mapping the flow of Lake Kilimanjaro is a challenge because mapping the flow of the 

Also, the agricultural land by Mt. Kilomanjaro is trying to be AS FLAT as possible and irrigation channels over the agricultural land. 
This means it's really hard to map the natural flow of water since humans have modified the process so much.

The vegetation around the river bed sometimes HIDES the natural feature. This means with satellite imagery, the trees will appear as a 
rise in elevation, rather than tree cover over a depression in the land where the water is flowing through --> This will really confuse
the network flow.

Looking at Hillshade model of SRTM, sometimes it's blurred and crossed. This is because there's a known value on boths sides of the river 
valley. However, the real value is a depression. SRTM then shades this in as blurry and not a river feature. What's going on? It's probably 
cloudy and the images cannot penetrate the clouds.
